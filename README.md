# kindlephy-wrapped

This is a project I just got an idea for on the 4th February 2025.
The basic idea is to have an android app that can keep track of your kindle library, figure out what you like, what to suggest to you and so on.
Also to have a feature like "spotify wrapped" where you have a roundup of your year of reading telling you how many books you read, what genre you read the most, what auther, so on.

The idea is still new, so it will continue to evolve. I imagine I will change a lot as well as it is developed.

For now, this is all to say :).
